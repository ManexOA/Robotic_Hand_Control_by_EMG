# Control of a Robotic Hand using Electromyography (EMG)

## Project description
In this project, a 3D printed prosthetic hand developed by Open Bionics company, and a Myoware muscle sensor are used. The project aims to control the prosthetic hand using the Myoware sensor and replicating the opening and closing movements of the human hand, with the robotic hand. For this, the on-off strategy is used, so that depending on the contraction of the muscle, the electric signal coming from the sensor will increase or decrease, allowing to change the gesture of the robotic hand whether the signal is below or above the threshold.
